# OECD Education and Skills `data-visuals`
A markdown file to show some data visuals using OECD Data on Education.

## Introduction
This repository hosts a couple of plots and maps made with the üá∑ package`ggplot2`. The visuals show current averages and trends on selected indicators. The document is meant to showcase the power 
üí™ of publicly available data and, in the spirit of transparency, I'll include the data-wrangling and plotting code snippets üë©üèª‚Äçüíª.

## OECD Education and Skills
### Cloropleth of Investment in Education

the `R`packages used were: 

* {[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)}: a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on [The Grammar of Graphics](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448/ref=as_li_ss_tl).
  
* {[cowplot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/vignettes/introduction.html)}: a simple add-on to ggplot. It provides various features that help with creating publication-quality figures, such as a set of themes, functions to align plots and arrange them into complex compound figures, and functions that make it easy to annotate plots and or mix plots with images.

* {[magick](https://docs.ropensci.org/magick/articles/intro.html): provide a modern and simple toolkit for image processing in R. It wraps the ImageMagick STL library.}

* {[maps](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RColorBrewer/index.html)}: display of maps. Projection code and larger maps are in separate packages ('mapproj' and 'mapdata').

* {[scales](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scales/index.html)}: a package that scales map data to aesthetics, and provides methods for automatically determining breaks and labels for axes and legends.

* {[ggtext](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggtext/index.html):} a `ggplot2` extension that enables the rendering of complex formatted plot labels (titles, subtitles, facet labels, axis labels, etc.). Text boxes with automatic word wrap are also supported.

* {[stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/articles/from-base.html):} a consistent, simple and easy to use set of wrappers around the fantastic stringi package.

* {[cartography](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cartography/vignettes/cartography.html):} offers thematic maps with the visual quality of those build with a classical mapping or GIS software. It includes color palettes for maps. 
  
* {[dplyr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/articles/from-base.html):} dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges.

**A comment:**
Perhaps what I find most interest from the visualisation above, is that the countries that have invested the most in Education in the last years (as a percentage of their GDP) are in South America (Argentina, Brazil) and South Africa. These are not countries with the highest PISA outcomes. It made me think of the old adage "quality over quantity". An idea that has been extensively explored in the literature by Eric Hanushek (e.g., [2007](https://hanushek.stanford.edu/publications/education-quality-and-economic-growth)). It is not only enough to financially invest in education, we also need to mobilise the invested resources efficiently, and increase budget transparency and equitable spending. Almost 20 years later, this [World Bank Blog on Education Finance](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/education/brief/education-finance-using-money-effectively-is-critical-to-improving-education) still emphasises those points.
